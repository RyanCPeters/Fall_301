# Welcome to my css301 repository!

The main purpose of this repo is to provide convenient access to the mock-web-page I've tinkered with for assignment #4.

## Instructions for how to view the webpage

GitHub isn't a web hosting service, so the the mock-web-page can't be opened directly from this repository.

### Downloading and unziping the files


Instead, you simply need to click on the green 'Clone or download' button on the upper right hand side of your screen (assuming you are viewing this page from a laptop or desktop computer.) After clicking on that button, a drop-down window will appear and at the bottom of that window will be 2 options: 'Open in Desktop' and 'Download ZIP.' Choose the download zip option, the files total to less than 20 megabytes.

All of the needed files will be downloaded in a single package so all you need to do is navigate to the directory you send your downloads to and unzip the file. It should appear as 'Fall_301-master.zip'

### Opening the web page

After you unzip the files, a new folder should have appeared by the name of 'Fall_301-master'. 
-- The -master part is GitHub's way of labeling the central directory for project update and revision tracking -- 

As an additoinal side note, I had to open a second folder layer by the same name again, this is fine if you don't mind the redudancy. Once you have the files opened, you will see a file named 'Launch_Assignment4_With_This_fil' -- the name says it all, just double click it and you should have a new tab in your browser open.

### That's it! There's nothing left to do but delete the files when you're done!
